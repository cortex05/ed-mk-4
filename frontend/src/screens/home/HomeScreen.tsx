            This site is meant to be a tool for people to use to find guidance
            in their studies. It is not a substitute for a course or a teacher,
            but rather supplemental resources that may shed light on a lesson or
            provide a direction for a student who lacking one. This site lacks
            the nuance of a human teacher with a planned curiculum that is

            personalization of various AI educational tools. This is a tool for
            users to take their education into their own hands and to help them

            The main benefit of this site is that it organizes K-12 education
            into two main organiazational structures: by grade level and by
            subject. Each of these ultimately leads to a course with units that
            are paired with FREE resources that go in depth on the subject
            matter.

            These resources can range from webpages that use illustrations for
            younger minds to documentation that would fit in a college textbook.
            They might be videos on apps like YouTube, or they might be as
            little as a great image that explains a single concept well.
